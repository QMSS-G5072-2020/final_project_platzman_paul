    "[CelebrityBucks](https://celebritybucks.com/) is an online game where celebrities are bought and sold like stocks, and players aim to maximize their earnings over time. Celebrities are assigned numerical dollar values based on their recent prevalance within news and entertainment media publications, and the more often they are mentioned, they higher their value becomes. As with stocks, game players pay for celebrities based on their current value and hope that their values increase over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Celebrity Bucks offers an API that provides the current price and ranking of each celebrity in its data set, it offers little else to players that would inform their buy/sell/hold game playing decisions. This package aims to remedy that. Specifically, it provides a data set containing each celebrity available in the Celebrity Bucks game alongside not only the information returned by the API, but additional information about each celebrity that may be useful to forecasting their future value. This includes information about how their current price compares to recent and all-time high prices, demographic attributes, and Celebrity Bucks's recommendation whether or not to buy that celebrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package also contains a user-ready Python script that enables users to create a new data set in a single line of code -- useful for collecting the most up to date celebrity information -- or that is importable as a module, where the file's many functions become available to the user. Either option avails Celebrity Bucks game players of a rich source of information useful for performing descriptive analysis, building predictive models, or otherwise informing game playing decisions."

    "\n",
    "This information is collected for each celebrity found in the Celebrity Bucks API return, i.e., all celebrities available to be bought, sold, or held in the game. Several attributes that appear in the data set are taken directly from these sources, such as a celebrity's gender or current Celebrity Bucks price. Other attributes are computed from available information, such as whether the celebrity has an upcoming birthday or the ratio of the celebrity's current price to their past 21-day price average. This tutorial will provide more detailed instructions on how to work with the data set and also how to use the Python code to accumulate more current information."
